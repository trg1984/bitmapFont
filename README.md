Bitmap Font
==========

Creates HTML-formatted text element from a single raster image. A nice tool to easily create custom look and feel to a website or to type letters using your personal handwriting.

Currently the program assumes that concurrent letters are separate from each other, and the order letters and size of the font are fixed. In future releases I plan to support JSON-based fonts with animated and vector-based graphics (svg, gif..).

## Usage

Main code block is in loadBitmapFont.js in the javascript folder. bitmapFont.html contains the reference implementation.
